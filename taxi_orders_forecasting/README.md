# Taxi Orders Forecasting

Congratulations! You have completed the course in the simulator. Now you can independently tackle a new machine learning task.

When you finish, submit your work for review to the reviewer: they will provide comments within 24 hours. After that, you need to refine the project and undergo reevaluation.

Most likely, you will refine the case based on the comments several times. This is normal.

The project is completed when the reviewer approves all the modifications.

## Project Description

The company "Fair Taxi" has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, it is necessary to forecast the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such prediction.

The RMSE metric value on the test sample should not exceed 48.

## Project Execution Instructions

1. Load the data and resample it on an hourly basis.
2. Analyze the data.
3. Train various models with different hyperparameters. Make a test sample of 10% of the original data.
4. Test the data on the test sample and draw conclusions.

## Data Description

Dataset 'taxi.csv'
The number of orders is in the column 'num_orders'.

## Project 2: Tariff plan classification for Megaline mobile operator
### Project Description

This project revolves around assisting the mobile operator "Megaline" in recommending appropriate tariffs, "Smart" or "Ultra", to its customers based on their behavior data. Utilizing preprocessed customer data, the aim is to develop a classification model achieving a minimum accuracy of 0.75 on the test set. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test subsets for model evaluation, where different models with varied hyperparameters are explored to optimize accuracy. As an additional task, model adequacy is examined to ensure reliability, acknowledging the potential complexity of the dataset.

## Project 3: Taxi Orders Forecasting
### Project Description

This project aims to forecast taxi orders at airports for the upcoming hour to help a company, "Fair Taxi," efficiently allocate resources during peak demand periods. Historical taxi order data is analyzed and various machine learning models are trained and tested using different hyperparameters. The goal is to achieve a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric value on the test dataset of no more than 48. Through this process, the project seeks to optimize driver allocation and improve service efficiency based on predictive analytics.
